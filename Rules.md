# The Campaign

_The Campaign_ is a politically-themed deck-builder, designed for four to ten players.

It\'s election season, and the candidates are out in force looking for ways to tempt voters over to their party, and dissuade them away from the parties of their opponents. To do this, they will need both an impressive repetoire of policies, and for the stars to align in their favour when it comes to the events that play out on the trail.

You are those candidates.

## Mechanics
### Concepts
**Political Capital**

Political Capital is the scorekeeping mechanism for _The Campaign_. A players Political Capital is determined by the sum of Political Capital values on the cards that they hold in their deck, in the state that they hold them. Once all players have reached the end of the board, the player with the most Political Capital after application of _The Multiplier_ wins.

**The Multiplier**

Once all players have finished, each players Political Capital has a multiplier applied. This multiplier is determined by the sum of multiplier values of the cards that the player holds in their deck. 

### Included pieces
**Objective cards**

Objective cards contain a list of objectives for players to attempt to achieve. For each objective completed, they will receive the reward specified on the card.

**Policy cards**

Policies form the bedrock of any political campaign - so they\'d better be good. Policy cards are doublesided. Their default state on pickup is \"*Active*\", but they can be flipped to \"*U-Turned*\". All Policy cards have a positive or negative Political Capital value. U-turning a card turns a positive Political Capital value to a negative Political Capital value, and vice versa.

All Policy Cards have an *Affilation*, which are relevant to allowing players to fulfil the objectives laid out in the *Objective Cards*.

The Policy Cards in a players deck are visible to all.

If you run out of Policy Cards, no additional policies can be collected by landing on the Policy squares.

**Event cards**

It wouldn\'t be a political campaign without unforeseeable events threatening to nudge one candidate closer to victory. Event cards contain scenarios, and instructions to follow. These events - amongst other things - could allow you to steal another players policies, call a referendum, or reveal a natural disaster. Instructions for each event are printed on the card.

Once drawn, event cards are set aside. If you run out of event cards, shuffle the used stack and reuse them.

**Influential Person cards**

During setup, players are dealt Influential Person cards. These cards are kept secret until such a point as the player discloses them by invoking them. The Influential Persons are as follows:
- The Media Mogul
- The Union Leader
- The Aristocrat
- The Traditionalist
- The Foreign Influence
- The Celebrity
- The Spin Doctor
- The Data Analytics Firm
- The Populist
- The Liberal

**Blackmail cards**

Politics may well be riddled with scandals and corruption, but on this rare occasion a politician has been caught red-handed. 

Through an _Event card_, players may be granted a Blackmail card that will allow them to apply the specified negative _Political Capital_ value to the deck of the player which it concerns. 

Blackmail cards list an _Influential Person_. If the player who holds the Blackmail card possesses that _Influential Person_, then the negative Political Capital value is multiplied by five.

When a Blackmail card is played, the target has the chance to appeal it in a defamation lawsuit. The target rolls two dice, and if both dice have the same value then they win the defamation lawsuit and the negative Political Capital value is assigned to the person who played the Blackmail card instead.

**Player pieces**

These pieces represent the players position on the board.

## How to Play
### Setup
Players position their player pieces at the starting point. Players take turns to roll two dice - the results, ordered from largest to smallest - determines the order of turns.

Every player is dealt an _Influential Person_ card.

Every player is dealt three _Policy Cards_ to start.

### How to Play
Players take turns to roll one die. They move forward by the amount of spaces that it shows. If they land on a _Policy_ square, or an _Event_ square - they will draw one card from the top of the respective pile. Players must add _Policy_ cards to their deck, and must read the instructions for Event cards out loud for all players to hear.

If players hold cards that can be applied to other players, they can (threaten to) invoke them at any time.

The game ends once all players have reached the end of the campaign trail. At this point, players tally their _Political Capital_, apply _The Multiplier_, and then disclose their score. The person with the largest amount of _Political Capital_ wins the game.
